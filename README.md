# Router1X3-Design-and-Verification
A 1X3 Router (capable of routing the data packets to three different clients form a single source network) was designed, including a register module that can hold data packets momentarily, to pass onto three different FIFO memories along with a Finite State Machine and a Synchronizer that can manipulate the internal signals to carry out the necessary task in convenient manner. - Most part of the project was simulated on Xilinx ISE and ISIM. Code Coverages were carried out on Questa Sim. And Verifiy the Test bench environment
